# THE ORGANIC STORE in BIRR
    This is the website for the Organic Store in Birr: ![The Organic Store](https://troeske.github.io/OrganicStore/index.html). The store is focussing on selling the best organic products from groceries to organic soaps and coffee, sourced locally wherever possible. It is located in the town Birr in Offerlay, Ireland.  
    
    As the store does not have a Web Site up to now, it aims to provide customers with an overview of products and services, location, opening hours and guiding principles. 
    
    The store is real as is their need for a web site and it is owned and operated by my sister and her husband.
